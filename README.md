This Project is done as part of an Outscal assessment test.
It is a Shop and Inventory Setup done in Unity.

Gameplay:-
Once the game is run, Shop and Inventory are loaded. Shop has all the available items under different Item Type Tabs, while inventory is Empty.
You are restricted from clicking any items in the shop and the Gather Resources is the only way to move forward.

Gather Resources Button - Adds random number of each item to the inventory based on a math formula involving cumulative value decided by item's rarity.

Shop allows buying items, Inventory allows selling items.

Each transaction goes through 5 stages:-
    1. Selection of item from shop/inventory,
    2. Item details shown in a panel with a mode of transaction depending on whether the item was selected from shop/inventory,
    3. An Item Count Setter Panel where you can adjust the number of items to be bought/sold while satisfying all conditions,
    4. A Transaction Confirmation Panel that offers the choice of YES or NO,
    5. An Overlay Message Panel displayed once the transaction is completed.
